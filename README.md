## FAQ

#### Why does this program need elevated privileges?

Netsh requires it in order to change IP addresses.

#### It doesn't show the interface I want to change!

The program only shows interfaces that already have an IP, which is usually only those already in a network. Connect another device to whatever port you want to change, wait a bit and refresh the list.
